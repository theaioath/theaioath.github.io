Hi there :) 

I'm Houda, I am a medical doctor and senior AI scientist currently living in Montreal, Canada.  
Just like all my peers, I gave an oath to do no harm, and I beleive this applies to the AI tools I develop as well. I have experience in computer vision on medical imaging, and recently started digging deeper in  explainable AI and responsible AI for healthcare. I'll be sharing around those topics, and documenting my learning in XAI on the AI lab.  

Stay tuned!
