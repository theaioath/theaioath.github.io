Hi there!
My name is Houda. I am a general medicine doctor and AI in healthcare consultant who left sunny Marrakech to snowy Montreal in order to learn about how AI can be used to improve medicine. I am really interested in learning how to have tools that are safe, inclusive and fair for all patients.
